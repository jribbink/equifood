# Software Description

The EquiFood software is meant as a way to connect consumers with food distribution businesses to reduce food waste by selling food at a discounted price that would otherwise go to waste. It's not designed to sell the products on its own, but only to allow this connection. The app functions by allowing businesses to post listings of food that they want to sell at a discounted price, which should have a list of tags that can be added to allow for easy searching later. These listings should have a geolocation attached; each restaurant would have a default geolocation, but it should be editable if necessary. The consumers are then able to log into the app and search for food they're interested in -- either by browsing food that is nearest to them, or by searching for food by name or by tag.

A potential option is for the customers to "reserve" the food, and have it removed from the listing so that they can be sure to pick it up. If this direction is taken, the app would notify the restaurant about the reservation, and require a specific timeline from the customer for when they will be able to pick the food up. If the customer does not follow through in that time, the reservation should be removed.

# User Groups

There are three main user groups that can be identified. One is the "admin" class of users; the programmers, administration and similar users working on the app itself, who should have global access to the app and all the functions therein. Another is the restaurants and other businesses, who should be able to log into the app through the business view to add, edit and remove the products they have available. The third group is the public; these users can open the app through the user view, and search for specific products or browse the products available near them.

# Non-Functional requirements and environmental constraints

    - There might not be any restaurants that support our app around certain users.
    - App will only support English major speaking countries with no localization to reduce development time.
    - The app does not support deliveries which might limit some usersâ€™ experiences.
    - User interface must be mobile friendly and support native mobile gestures.
    - Software must be cross-platform and supported on both IOS and Android devices.
    - Inventories must be reliable and up-to-date to prevent invalid orders.
