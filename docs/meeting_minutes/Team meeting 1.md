# Meeting minutes Equifoods C

-Everyone has read the email given to us and have discussed it.

-We have delegated tasks for the Requirements report.

-We have discussed what will need to be prepared before the next client meeting (questions
and funding).

-All tasks for the Requirements report should be done by the end of next week (oct 7).

● A high-level description (about one paragraph) of the software you
are building and who the target user groups are. Separately, explain
how each user group is expected to use the software differently. (Recall
that in order for two users to be considered as being in two different user

groups, they must use the system differently either via a functional or
non-functional system requirement.) JORDAN C

● An overview of your system architecture presented as a data flow
diagram (DFD), at both levels 0 and level 1, along with accompanying
descriptions for each diagram. You must be very specific in this DFD so to
design it in a way that supports an incremental and iterative development
process. You can read an intro on DFDs and adopt its notation.
Remember that a process does something, so be sure to use a verb to
label your processes. In describing your DFD, highlight clearly which
components will be delivered for each of the following milestones:
peer testing #1, peer testing #2, and the final product. You may
additionally wish to include extra components and label them as bonus
features that may be developed if time allows. RILEY C

● A detailed list of functional requirements for each milestone. Be sure
to separate out the functional requirements for each system component
based on the target milestone. JOONSIK K

● A detailed list of non-functional requirements and environmental
constraints for the overall project. The environmental constrains are
similar to non-functional requirements and explains the constrains related
to system’s environment. Some examples are interfaces to other systems,
COTS components, programming language, system's location, size,
power consumption, humidity, maintenance accessibility, ...etc. JOONSIK

● Identify the tech stack you plan to use. If this is the tech stack required
by your client, then state that in the document. If your client is flexible,
you must indicate a clear rationale of the choice made. This means an
extra page with a table of at least 3 options and document all pros and
cons for each before letting your client make a choice. JORDAN R

● An explanation of how you will test the developed features of your
system (in accordance with the tech stack chosen) as well as the
method you will adopt to ensure continuous integration. Don't just use
a technical term to describe the method; write a few sentences to explain
the tools and techniques that will be involved. Read up on regression
testing, and develop a feasible plan that ensures when new code is added
to your project that your project didn't break anything that was working
before.
